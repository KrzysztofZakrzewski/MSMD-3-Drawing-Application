I've decided to expand this application with an interface that works on both mobile devices and desktops. Of course, the CSS is not optimal and there are significant shortcomings due to the fact that the idea for expansion was improvised. Certainly, it's striking to split the "Instructions" popup class into "Info". There wasn't really time for backward fixes, but it makes you think about how important it is to think through the structure.

JavaScript could certainly have been written better. I also used Chat GPT for support. I wrote some functions myself, some not, but most of them are understandable to me except for the more advanced canvas.

Also, GIT seems more coherent and logical to me, although it still requires some work.
